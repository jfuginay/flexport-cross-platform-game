# Container 6: iOS Progression + Enhanced Graphics Systems

## Priority: MEDIUM - iOS Platform
## Objective: Implement progression features with enhanced graphics for dual-view support

### Requirements:
- Swift progression system matching web features
- Core Data persistence for player progress
- iOS-specific achievement integration
- Game Center leaderboards
- **ENHANCED GRAPHICS FOR DUAL-VIEW:**
  - High-quality ocean rendering with Metal shaders
  - Advanced ship sprites with animations
  - Dynamic lighting and particle effects
  - Optimized graphics pipeline for 60 FPS

### Focus Areas:
1. iOS progression system implementation
2. Core Data models for persistence
3. Game Center integration
4. **Enhanced Graphics Engine:**
   - `MetalOceanRenderer.swift` - Advanced water/ocean graphics
   - `ShipSpriteManager.swift` - High-quality ship animations
   - `ParticleSystemManager.swift` - Wake effects and particles
   - `GraphicsQualityManager.swift` - Performance scaling
5. SwiftUI progression UI with graphics integration

### Success Criteria:
- Feature parity with web progression
- Persistent progress across sessions
- Native iOS achievement notifications
- Game Center leaderboard integration
- **Enhanced Graphics**:
  - Stunning ocean visuals with realistic water simulation
  - Smooth ship animations and wake effects
  - Dynamic day/night cycles and weather effects
  - Consistent 60 FPS in landscape mode
  - Adaptive quality settings for older devices

### Graphics Specifications:
**Ocean Rendering:**
- Metal-based water simulation with wave patterns
- Realistic reflections and foam effects
- Dynamic color changes based on time/weather

**Ship Graphics:**
- High-resolution ship sprites with multiple animation frames
- Realistic wake trails using particle systems
- Ship lighting that responds to environmental conditions

**Performance Optimization:**
- LOD (Level of Detail) system for distant objects
- Dynamic quality scaling based on device capabilities
- Efficient memory management for graphics assets

### Files to Focus On:
- FlexPort iOS/Sources/FlexPort/Game/Systems/
- FlexPort iOS/Sources/FlexPort/UI/Metal/ (graphics engine)
- iOS Core Data models
- Game Center integration
- Metal shader files (.metal)
