### **AI Utilization Strategy - "Let Go and Let Claude"**

#### **Background Context**
As a Senior AI Software Engineer with experience in TypeScript, Python, and basic Kotlin, the challenge was mastering **game-specific technologies** and **iOS development** from scratch. With a philosophy of "Let go and let Claude," I leveraged AI to accelerate learning in completely unfamiliar domains.

#### **Learning Acceleration Techniques**
1. **Game Architecture Fundamentals**
   ```
   AI Prompt: "I've never built games before. Explain Entity Component 
   Systems and how they differ from traditional OOP for game development"
   ```

2. **Sprite Management & Rendering**
   ```
   AI Prompt: "Coming from web development, how do I implement sprite
   sheets, animation states, and batch rendering for a 2D game?"
   ```

3. **iOS Development from Zero**
   ```
   AI Prompt: "I have zero Swift/SwiftUI experience. Create a Metal
   shader for ocean rendering and explain each concept as you go"
   ```

4. **Game Loop Design**
   ```
   AI Prompt: "Explain fixed vs variable timestep game loops and help
   me implement one that works across iOS, Android, and Web"
   ```

5. **Collision Detection Systems**
   ```
   AI Prompt: "Design a spatial partitioning system for collision
   detection in a logistics game with hundreds of ships"
   ```
