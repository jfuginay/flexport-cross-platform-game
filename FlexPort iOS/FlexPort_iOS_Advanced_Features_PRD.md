- Asset streaming
- Analytics integration
- Crash reporting
- A/B testing framework

**Dependencies**: All containers
**Output**: Performance tools in `Sources/FlexPort/Utils/Performance/`

### Coordination Protocol

Each container will:
1. Pull latest code on startup
2. Create feature branch `claude-container-X-feature`
3. Report progress every 30 minutes
4. Coordinate through shared `PROGRESS.md` file
5. Handle merge conflicts collaboratively
6. Run tests before committing

### Success Metrics
- 60 FPS on iPhone 12 and newer
- Support for 10,000+ simultaneous entities
- Network latency under 100ms
- Load time under 3 seconds
- Memory usage under 500MB

### Timeline
- Hour 1-2: Containers 1-4 establish foundations
- Hour 3-4: Containers 5-7 build on core systems  
- Hour 5-6: Containers 8-10 polish and optimize
- Hour 7-8: Integration testing and bug fixes

### Container Launch Commands

```bash
# Launch all containers
for i in {1..10}; do
  docker run -d \
    --name flexport-claude-$i \
    --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/workspace \
    -e CONTAINER_ID=$i \
    -e CONTAINER_ROLE="See roles above" \
    -e GIT_BRANCH="claude-container-$i-feature" \
    anthropic/claude-dev:latest \
    --task "Implement FlexPort iOS features as Container $i"
done
```
