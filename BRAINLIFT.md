â”œâ”€â”€ Container 2: Real-time Ship Movement Sync
â”œâ”€â”€ Container 3: Player Progression & Leveling
â””â”€â”€ Container 4: Performance & Lag Compensation

iOS Platform (Priority 2 - Premium Mobile)
â”œâ”€â”€ Container 5: Multiplayer + Dual-View System
â””â”€â”€ Container 6: Metal Graphics + Progression

Android Platform (Priority 3 - Cross-Platform)
