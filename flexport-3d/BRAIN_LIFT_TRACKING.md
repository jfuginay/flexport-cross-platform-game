# FlexPort Global - Brain Lift Tracking

## Session: January 20, 2025

### Achievements
✅ **Fixed Ship Movement Issues**
- Ships were moving too fast and flickering on the map
- Reduced speed multiplier from 500x → 100x → 20x for realistic movement
- Implemented smooth position interpolation with 97% decay factor
- Added frame rate limiting to 30 FPS for consistent animation
- Synchronized game update rate with visual update rate
- Ships now move at watchable speeds with smooth, fluid motion

✅ **Improved Tutorial Flow**
- Created comprehensive onboarding through Ryan Petersen advisor
- Tutorial guides players through: Port purchase → Ship purchase → Contract assignment
- Increased starting money to $250M-$300M depending on game mode
- Reduced port cost from $50M to $25M for better game balance

✅ **Removed Unnecessary Features**
- Eliminated daily rewards system (game sessions are 5-30 minutes)
- Removed free ship functionality
- Cleaned up AI starter ships from UI

✅ **Fixed Critical Bugs**
- Resolved duplicate Shanghai port entries
- Fixed port purchase affordability issues
- Corrected ship ownership filtering throughout UI
- Fixed "anim is not defined" error in MapboxMap
- Resolved "ports is not defined" error in RyanPetersenAdvisor

✅ **Deployed to Production**
- Set up GitHub Pages deployment
- Site now live at: https://jfuginay.github.io/flexport-cross-platform-game
- Added automated deployment scripts

### Technical Improvements
- Reduced console logging for better performance
- Implemented coordinate validation to prevent NaN values
- Added position bounds checking for ship movement
- Improved error handling in animation loops

### Next Steps (TODO)
- Create more realistic ship and port icons
- Optimize bundle size (currently 912KB gzipped)
- Add sound effects for ship activities
- Implement weather effects on map
- Create ship trail visualization
- Add port capacity indicators

### Performance Metrics
- Frame rate: Stable 30 FPS
- Ship position updates: Smooth interpolation
- Bundle size: 912.7 KB (needs optimization)
- Deployment time: ~2 minutes to GitHub Pages

### User Feedback Addressed
- "ship is freaking out less but still sporadic" → Fixed with interpolation
- "still moving too fast" → Reduced speed to 1/25th of original
- Ships now have realistic, observable movement speeds
